        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Japanese soufflé pancakes is inspired by American pancakes, but they differ due to the extra egg whites added. A meringue mixture is beaten to stiff peaks, then folded into the batter, which allows the pancakes to achieve their distinctive height. The batter must be cooked at a very low temperature to be successful. These custardy pancakes are perfect for breakfast, an afternoon snack, or even dessert.</p>

        <h2>Insturctions</h2>
        <h3>Time: 30 Minutes</h3>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Place egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer or a medium bowl; set aside. Place egg yolks in a large bowl. Add 1 tablespoon granulated sugar, the vanilla and baking powder to egg yolks and whisk until blended. Add flour and milk; whisk until fully combined.</p>

        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Add lemon juice and salt to egg whites. Using a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or a hand mixer, whip mixture on medium speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Continue to whip over medium while gradually sprinkling with remaining 5 tablespoons granulated sugar. Turn speed to high and whip until stiff, glossy peaks form and mixture doubles in size, about 1 minute. Take care not to overbeat meringue.</p>

        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Heat a lidded nonstick skillet over the lowest heat setting and set the lid aside.</p>

        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Using a rubber spatula, scoop about ⅓ of meringue into egg yolk mixture and gently fold almost combined. Repeat with half the remaining meringue until almost combined, then fold in the remaining meringue just until no streaks remain.</p>

        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>Carefully grease the warm skillet and the inside of four 3-inch-wide pastry rings using the butter. Check the heat of the pan by sprinkling a bit of water in it: Droplets should steam off the surface, but not dance or sputter. Place the greased pastry rings in the warm pan and ladle a scant ½ cup batter into each ring. Place lid on top of skillet and cook pancakes on very low heat until they start to rise and a few small bubbles start to form on top, 3 to 4 minutes.</p>

        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <p>Remove lid, carefully slide a flat spatula underneath each pancake and position another spatula on top, then gently flip pancakes in their rings. Immediately replace lid and cook until pancakes are cooked through and spring back to the touch, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer cooked pancakes to a platter, grease the skillet and pastry rings and repeat to make 4 additional pancakes.</p>

        <h3>Step 7</h3>
        <p>Top pancakes with a pat of butter and drizzle with maple syrup; serve immediately. Serve with any combination of confectioners’ sugar, whipped cream and berries, if desired.</p>

        <h2 class="sep">Recipe Website Reviews</h2>
        <h3><a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/">NYT Cooking</a></h3>
        <p>NYT Cooking does a great job laying out their page. The first thing you see is an image of what you should expect the food to look like along with a decription. As you scroll down you can view the ingredient list and instruction at the sametime. This makes it easy for viewers to follow along without having to scroll back and forth. They also have links to alternatives just in case the user does not have certain things.</p>
        <h3><a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/">Food Network</a></h3>
        <p>The design for Food Network is simple. It has one page dedicated to introducing the reciepe and another dedicated to the directions. It is a little hard to find the link to the description. Description page is well layout. I like how it gives the level, time, and serving at the top before seeing the ingredient and instructions.</p>
        <h3><a href="https://www.yummly.com/">Yummly</a></h3>
        <p>Yummly has a very interesting landing page. The landing page is an introduction to the food which gives you the description, ingredients, time, and nutrition facts. From there if the user decides to pursue making the dish, Yummly directs the user to a different page to follow the instructions. I find it nice that it gives lots of details to help the user make a decision, but having the user go on to a different page is not very efficient, espeically if the user wants to know how hard it is to make the dish.</p>

        <h2>Non-Recipe Website Reviews</h2>
        <h3><a href="https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca">Wealthsimple</a></h3>
        <p>I like how Wealthsimple very simple design. The scroll is interactive as well which keeps the user engaged, but the interactivness is simple enough that it is still accessibility. It subtly section information which makes it easy for the eyes to scan through the information.</p>
        <h3><a href="https://goradar.com/">Radar</a></h3>
        <p>The scroll on Radar is really nice. It sections off the information and imagery allowing the user to focus on thing at a time without feeling overwhelmed. The images also moves giving another layer of information that couldn't be communicated through images</p>
        <h3><a href="https://www.lovethesales.com/">lovethesales</a></h3>
        <p class="last">Lovethesales does a great job utalizing colunns. The columns allow it to showcase a lot of information while also making sure there is a lot of white space so that the user won't be overwhelemd. The color palette is also very minimalistic which balances out with all the imagery making the website easy to scan through.</p>

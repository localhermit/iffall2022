                <p>That wasn't funny but she <em>laughed so <strong>hard</strong></em>, she almost cried</p>
                <p> They're counting months they've been <em>together</em>, almost 49</p>
                <p> He's making fun of how she acted 'round the holidays</p>
                <p class="pspace">She wears a ring but they tell people that they're not <em>engaged</em></p>

                <p>They met in class for metaphysical philosophy</p>
                <p>He tells his friends, <em>"I like her 'cause she's so much smarter than me"</em></p>
                <p>They're having talks about their futures until 4:00 a.m.</p>
                <p class="pspace">And <em>I'm happy</em> for them (and I'm happy for them)</p>

                <p><em>But I wanna <strong>feel</strong> all that love and emotion.</em></p>
                <p>Be that attached to the person I'm holding</p>
                <p> Someday, I'll be falling without caution</p>
                <p class="pspace">But for now, I'm only <em>people watching</em></p>

                <p>I'm only looking just to live through you vicariously</p>
                <p>I've <strong>never really</strong> been in love, not seriously</p>
                <p>I had a dream about a house behind a picket fence</p>
                <p class="pspace">Next one I choose to trust, I hope I use some <em>common sense</em> </p>

                <p>But I cut people out like tags on my clothing</p>
                <p class="pspace">I end up all alone but I still keep <em><strong>hoping.</strong></em></p>

                <p><em>But I wanna <strong>feel</strong> all that love and emotion.</em></p>
                <p>Be that attached to the person I'm holding</p>

                <p> I end up all <strong>alone</strong> but I still keep hoping</p>
                <p> I won't be scared to let someone know me</p>
                <p>Life feels so monotone but I still keep hoping</p>

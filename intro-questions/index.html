            <li>Website: https://www.etq-amsterdam.com/
                I find ETQ very aesthetically pleasing because their website reflects the tone they are going for which can be found in their products.

            <li>Website: https://www.flyhyer.com/
                The spacing and imagery all effectively lead the user throughout the website allowing the text and layout to communicate Hyer's values and services.

            <li>Website: https://linktr.ee/
                I think linktree's new design does a great job communicating the path it is headed towards, to make next-gen tools for creators and brands.

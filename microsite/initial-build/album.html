                        <h1>2 COOL 4 SKOOL</h1>
                        <p>This is the product of the firm conviction and passion of BTS that hip hop musicians must make their voices heard through their albums. Each member flexed their musical prowess by taking part in creating the lyrics and music for every song on the album. BTS has repeatedly said that “hip hop is genuine music for telling one’s own story,” and indeed the members rap about their own experiences and emotions.</p>

                        <p>With O!RUL8,2? (Oh! Are you late, too?), BTS offers the message that “you must find your happiness and your own life before it’s too late.” Lyrics that brutally lay open reality as it is deliver a bold admonition to a world that inflicts despair. Children are raised as studying machines without a chance to think about the future. A world where classmates are not friends but competitors trying to trample each other.</p>

                        <p>The album’s main theme is the love that blossoms in the school. This album is a culmination of the “School Trilogy” project that discusses the topics of most interest to teens their own age—dreams, happiness and love. Such penetrating insight into the hearts and minds of young people led to the absolute support that BTS has received from fans their age.</p>

                        <p>BTS sings about love gone awry in DARK & WILD. They warn the girl who acts like she doesn't love them not to test their love anymore. The boys are no longer in their school uniforms. They have become tougher, singing that their love is not to be treated lightly. Tracks that highlight the different genres of hip hop—South, West, Boom Bap and Trap—provide a clear direction of BTS' music.</p>

                        <p>No longer just young boys, the album is an introduction to BTS as a group that continues to grow and develop. In each track are distilled poetic and pop emotions that allows the listener to sense both the soft and the resounding musical transformation of the group. The album focuses on the uncertain future more than the glamour of youth, start of one’s young adulthood and how beauty coexists with the uncertainty.</p>

                        <p>The most beautiful moment in life pt.2 sings about the energy of youth barreling forward, embracing even the uncertainty and insecurity. Now beginning to taste the bitterness of grown-up life, they can easily sense that life isn't always beautiful. However, they continue to sprint forward, relying only on their two destitute legs and the fire in their hearts. Facing the powerlessness of one’s youth, they collide and shatter and still cry out that “it’s okay to fall, it’s okay to get hurt.” That is the beauty of this moment.</p>

                        <p>TWINGS contains songs about boys who encounter temptation for the first time and must ponder and agonize in the face of it.

                        <p>LOVE YOURSELF 承 'HER' is an expression of the anxiety and elation of love, told in the unique style of BTS. The “love” that BTS aims to convey in the LOVE YOURSELF series is both the individual experience of a boy growing into adulthood and a message of peace and unity to our society today. In the mini album 承 'HER' that begins this new narrative, the image of boys in love for the first time are expressed in a refreshing and cheerful take that aims to talk about the topic of “love” while immersed in a coming-of-age tale.</p>

                        <p>First unveiled in March of 2016, the BTS LOVE YOURSELF series creates a narrative by linking the key songs in each album into a single theme, imparting the message that “loving yourself is true love”. Like a well-written novel having introduction, development, twists, and conclusion it shared a compelling story for two and a half years.</p>
                        <p>‘ANSWER’ is the final piece of the puzzle. Though it’s a repackaged album, LOVE YOURSELF 結 ‘ANSWER’ still includes seven brand-new tracks. CD A is a concept album, its sixteen tracks all connected lyrically to highlight BTS’ prowess as both artists and storytellers.</p>

                        <p>“MAP OF THE SOUL : 7” looks back on the past seven years of BTS since their debut as seven members of one team. The journey was not always smooth sailing, and there were special travails that they had to endure in their rise as global superstars. Now, understanding that the scars left by those hardships is a part of their real selves, BTS accepts both “the self I want to show” and the “self I want to scorn” to at last tell their own story of finding their “real and complete selves”.</p>

The album consists of a total of eight tracks including the No.1 summer hit “Dynamite” and lead single “Life Goes On”. The latter speaks on behalf of everyone stuck in the new normality brought on by COVID-19: one day, the world stopped without any warning, streets erased of footsteps and the way out is nowhere near in sight.</p>
